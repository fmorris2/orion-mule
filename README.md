# Orion Mule

## Overview
This is a submodule of the main Orion bot farm project. The mission of Orion Mule is to provide logic for the "mule" accounts of the overall
bot farm. Mule accounts have one task - Log into the game to collect farmed materials from the "worker" bots. This allows for a more centralized
"bank" of materials, and keeps the farm much more organized. It also helps mitigate damage that bans do to the farm - The worker accounts will at
least offload materials before they get banned.
